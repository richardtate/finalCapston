Finance Calculators allows a user to use two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.  The user initially has two choices, investment or bond.  Investment calculates interest on a sum of money invested over a term, and bond calculates monthly mortgage payments on a sum borrowed against a house.

* investment - input money invested, interest rate and the number of years investing over and either simple or compound interest.
* bond - input the value of the house, the interest rate, and the number of months repayments will be over.
